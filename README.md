Speeds and Feeds app named funny
My first actual app, named funny because I maxed out the 10 free app signings in Xcode by playing with their tutorial.
I used this existing file name to create my actual app "Speeds and Feeds".
I'll look into renaming it later, I hope, but it's working fine now.
It would have been nice if they warned you ANYWHERE about the 10 file weekly limit:-(
Even the Developer account support lady didn't know about it....
